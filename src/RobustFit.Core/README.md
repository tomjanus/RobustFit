# RobustFit Library

## Overview
RobustFit is a library designed for robust regression analysis. It provides tools to fit regression models that are less sensitive to outliers in the data, making it suitable for real-world datasets where anomalies may exist.

## Features
- **Robust Regression**: The library implements robust regression techniques to provide reliable estimates even in the presence of outliers.
- **Custom Loss Functions**: Users can define their own loss functions to tailor the fitting process to specific needs.
- **Utility Functions**: Includes various linear algebra utility functions to facilitate regression analysis.

## Installation
To use the RobustFit library, include it in your project by referencing the compiled DLL or by adding it as a dependency in your project file.

## Usage
1. **Create an instance of `RobustRegressor`**:
   ```csharp
   var regressor = new RobustRegressor();
   ```

2. **Fit the model**:
   ```csharp
   regressor.Fit(X, y, lossFunction);
   ```

3. **Make predictions**:
   ```csharp
   double prediction = regressor.Predict(new double[] { /* feature values */ });
   ```
